"""A package of various inference engines (reasoner), or at least of proxies

engine.any()
    see what it can import and instantiate, and does one.
    maybe give it the store
    * Given a list of classes (not modules)

WHAT about having this hidden inside the store?   Or as MixIn?


    x>>> import LX.engine.external_otter
    x>>> e = LX.engine.external_otter
    e = 
An engine is something which can look at a the contents of a
store and tell you if it's consistent and what you can 


OLD ToDoPerhaps:
   allow module name and engine name to be different
   give some metadata
   know which modules will work on this platform
