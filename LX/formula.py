    This may be used as a tuple with the first element being the

       (all, x, (and, (predicate, rdf, a, b, x),

    can return a Conjunction and a Sentence.  If we care; I'm not
    sure there's much desire to use the natural class hierarchy of
    logical expressions.

# $Log$
# Revision 1.4  2002-10-03 16:13:02  sandro
# some minor changes to LX-formula stuff, but it's still broken in ways
# that don't show up on the regression test.
#
# mostly: moved llyn-LX conversion stuff out of llyn.py, into
# LX.engine.llynInterface.py
#
# Revision 1.3  2002/10/02 22:56:35  sandro
# Switched cwm main-loop to keeping state in llyn AND/OR an LX.formula,
# as needed by each command-line option.  Also factored out common
# language code in main loop, so cwm can handle more than just "rdf" and
# "n3".  New functionality is not thoroughly tested, but old functionality
# is and should be fine.  Also did a few changes to LX variable
# handling.
#
# Revision 1.2  2002/10/02 20:40:56  sandro
# make --flatten recognize log:means as the biconditional and
# log:Falsehood for a formula as its negation.
#
# Revision 1.1  2002/08/29 11:00:46  sandro
# initial version, mostly written or heavily rewritten over the past
# week (not thoroughly tested)
#
