"""
An immutable object, for which you define the properties at creation time. 

I find it useful for passing along during recursion, when we want only
the path from the root to the current node to be able to affect our
parameters.  Reduces clutter, and allows recursion though
general-purpose functions: as long as they pass along a ladder, they
don't need to know about our particular parameters.

Is this a software pattern?
