    A set, with reasons why things are in it, and watchers.  A
    WatchableSupportedElementSet, if you like.  :-)  Order of adds
    is also preserved.  (although not among the reasons right now.)

    When you add, you supply a reason

    When you remove, you say which reason is no longer valid.  When
    all reasons for an element are gone, the element gets removed.
    
    At this level we don't actually *look* at the formula or reason at
    all!   The examples just use strings.   I imagine this will be
    used with LX.expr's as the formula (element).  I'm not yet sure
    what structure the reasons/justifications might take.

    * WATCHERS -- USED FOR MIRRORING...

    (I want this for Node-centric form to be kept in sync, not
    to mention all sorts of .... other stuff.)
    - like adding dt theory
    - cache stuff / network watch
    - delta/sigma views -- reason will need to be described uri in
      some store?   python object which can get described?
