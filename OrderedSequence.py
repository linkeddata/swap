"""Utility functions for ordered seqeunces

When you are dealing with sequences which you know are ordered,
then set operations are linear instead of square in the length of the
sequences. This makes an ordered sequence a practical representation of a set.

@@ Now python has sets, these should be used where the ordering is not otherwise
necessary.  @@ check
