Diff patch and streams</p>

<h1>Differences, Patches and event streams</h1>

<p>There are lots of reasons for comparing two RDF files. In this section we
will compare some of the different ways. We will look specifically at ways
which generate "patch" files - machine-readable files expressing the
difference which</p>

<h2>Just comparing RDF files</h2>

<p>In some cases, you can tell that two RDF graphs are the same by printing
them out with cwm and comparing the files. That's what a lot of the cwm test
cases do. Cwm actually tries to make this more successful by being consistent
with the way it formats a file, and the order in which it prints things. This
also means that if you are tracking changes to RDF data using a code
management system such as RCS or CVS, small changes to the data will tend to
make small changes in the N3 file.</p>

<p>While this works quite well for comparing different versions of the same
file, it doesn't really work for comparing with a file from a completely
different source. The problem is that in a lot of cases, the way a a file is
written out involves some arbitrary choices which could be made differently
in the two files being compared. The main problem is the way blank nodes are
given arbitrary identifiers, bnodeID in XML, or "forSome" variable names in
N3, and _: namespace names in NTriples. To actually print any file out in a
standard way so that any file which expressed the same RDF data will come out
the same is called making a canonical form, or canonicalizing.</p>

<p>There are a number of programs which canonicalize a file. NTriples, a very
simplified form of N3, is the language used for most test cases. The SWAP
code includes a python program (cant.py) which under most practical
circumstances will find a canonical form for an NTriples file. If you give it
two files, it will canonicalize each internally and compare them. The Jena
toolkit includes another.</p>

<p>Comparing files by canonicalizing them is Ok for tests. Now lets look
