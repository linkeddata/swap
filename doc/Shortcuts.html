<h1>Shorthand: Paths and lists</h1>

<p>You don't need to know this. It just makes life easier, and of course
helps when reading other people's work.</p>

<h2><a name="Paths" id="Paths">Paths</a></h2>

<p>Often it turns out that you need to refer to something indirectly through
a string of properties, such as "George's mother's assistant's home's
address' zipcode". This is traversal of the graph. In the N3 we have dealt
with up till now, this would look something like</p>
<pre>[is con:zipcode of [
    is con:address of [
        is con:home of [
            is off:assistant of [
                is rel:mother of :George]]]]]</pre>

<p>which reads "that which is the zipcode of that which is the address of
that which is the home of that which is the assistant of that which is the
mother of :George", which isn't very convenient to read or write. And this is
when in an object-oriented language, you would just cascade methods or
attributes on properties using ".".</p>

<p>To make it easier in N3 there is a shortcut for the above would just be
written</p>
<pre>:George.rel:mother
          .off:assistant
            .con:home
              .con:address
                 .con:zipcode</pre>

<p></p>

<p>The dot must be immediately followed by the next thing, with no
whitespace.</p>

<p>This is forward traversal of the graph, where with each "." you move from
something to its property. So ?x.con:mailbox is x's mailbox, and in fact in
english you can read the "." as " 's".</p>

<p>You can do backward traversal, using "^" instead of "." as punctuation. So
if :me.con:mailbox means my mailbox, then
&lt;mailto:ora@lassila.com&gt;^con:mailbox is that which has
&lt;mailto:ora@lassila.com&gt; as a mailbox. This backward traversal is less
usual - you can't do it object-oriented programming languages -- but
sometimes its what you need.</p>

<p>Note that there isn't necessarily only one match for a path - often there
are many, when it is used on the left side of a rule.</p>
<pre>:me.rel:parent</pre>

<p>would be "Some x such that I have parent x", and</p>
<pre>:me.rel:parent^rel:parent</pre>

<p>would mean "Some y such that for some x, I had parent x and y had parent
x", or loosely, some sibling of mine. In this imaginary ontology,
".rel:child" is equivalent to "^rel:parent".</p>

<p>Whatever the sequence of "." and "^", they always are read left to right
across the page.</p>

<p>These are known as "paths". If you are used to XML, think: Xpath but
simpler. If you think of the circles and arrows graph of data, think of a
path from node to node.</p>

<p>Cwm doesn't currently use paths on output, so getting cwm to input and
output a file will turn it into the form of N3 you already know.</p>

<h2 id="Lists">Lists</h2>

<p>A common need is to represent an ordered collection of things. This is
done in RDF as a rdf:Collection. In N3, the list is represented by separating
the objects with whitespace and surrounding them with parentheses. Examples
are:</p>
<pre>( "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" )

(:x :y)

( :cust.bus:order.bus:number 
  :cust.bus:order
      .bus:referncedPurchaseOrder
          .bus:number )</pre>

<p>These lists are actually shorthand for statements which knit blank nodes
together using <code>rdf:first</code> and <code>rdf:rest</code>.
<code>rdf:first</code> is the relationship between a list and its first
component. <code>rdf:rest</code> if the relationship between a list and the
list of everything except its first element. <code>rdf:nil</code> is the name
for the empty list. Therefore,</p>
<pre>( "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" )</pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>[ rdf:first "Monday";
  rdf:next [ rdf:first "Tuesday";
             rdf:rest [ rdf:first "Wednesday";
                        rdf:rest rdf:nil ]]]</pre>

<p>One of the common uses of lists is as parameter to a relationship which
has more than one argument.</p>
<pre>(  "Dear " ?name " "," )   
             string:concatenation   ?salutation.</pre>

<p></p>

<p>for example, indicates that the salutation is the string concatenation of
the three strings "Dear", whatever ?name is, and a comma. This will be used
with built-in functions which we will discuss later.</p>

<h3>Getting rid of the leading ":" with @<a name="keywords"
id="keywords">keywords</a></h3>

<p>In the examples, often we have been using terms in the default namespace,
like :me  or :father or :People.  The ":" is there because we don't want to
get confused with keywords which are part of the syntax, like  <em>a</em>,
<em>is</em>, <em>of</em>, and <em>prefix</em>.  Further, we want to be able
to add more keywords later to extend the syntax, and you don't want to find
that your files which happened to use that word as a name are all out of
date.</p>

<p>The solution is that if you really want to be able to write N3 without
that leading ":", then you can declare which keywords you are going to use. 
When you have done that, then everything which is <em>not</em> in the list is
allowed without a colon, and will be taken as a name.  To actually use the
keyword, you have to use an explicit "@" as you have been doing with "prefix"
all along.</p>

<p>Here is an example in which all they keywords are removed, so "@" is used
all the time:</p>
<pre>@keywords.
@prefix : &lt;#&gt;.
me @a Person.
Jo @a Person; @is sister @of me.
Jo father Alan; mother Flo.
Alan father Zak; brother Ed, Julian.</pre>

<p>Here is an example in which the normal keywords used are all declared.</p>
<pre>@keywords a, is, of, this.
@prefix : &lt;#&gt;.
me a Person.
Jo a Person; is sister of me.
Jo father Alan; mother Flo.
Alan father Zak; brother Ed, Julian.</pre>

<p>Note that is you have declared something a keyword, then you can still use
the "@" in front of it if you want to, as in "@prefix" above. </p>

<p>Obviously, you can't declared <em>a</em> to be a keyword, and then call
your variables <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>!</p>
