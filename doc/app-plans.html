<p></p>

<p>You don't get an appreciation of a technology until you have tried to usit
for real.  We have plans to use the cwm platform for many things -- we don't
know how much we will time for.</p>

    page to that.</li>

    small requests for enhancement) are tracked in RDF, and available as a
    TODO list in an online calendar.</li>

<h2>Software installation problem</h2>

<p></p>

<p>Each module lives on the web, and can be installed on demand, but also the
dependencies are all known or determined, and the system can transparently
install a system by just making a persistent cache of everything.  Do this to
(a) OWL ontologies and linked  metainformation; (b) Sets of rule files; (c)
debian packages (d) python packages -- with a little tweaking of the insides
of the python package system. G</p>

<p></p>

<p>General problem statement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Article <em><a href="/DesignIssues/Installation.html">Installation,
    Catalogs, and Caches</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p>Ontologies involved (find, or collborate in development of)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dependency</li>
  <li>Packaging includion</li>
  <li>Versioning, obsolescence</li>
</ul>

<p>Techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li>getting from one state to another (eg uninstalled to installed, etc) is
    goal-based.</li>
  <li>Making a user aware of the total amount of resources used by a given
    top-level need is a graphic user interface challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building Secure systems from scratch</h2>

<p></p>

<p>One goal here is to build a system without relying on external agencies to
provide key infrastrurcture, authentication, so that the whole system is
expressed in N3, and proofs can therefore be don..</p>

<p>An alternative goal is to import an existing systems such as PKI, XKMS,
GPGinto the RDF world by interfacing to the existing systems and converting
into and out of RDF.</p>

<p>It would not be a goal to develop a specific ontology for policy as a
standard or recommended one -- we assume that policy systems will take much
time to develop.</p>

<p>A goal would be to test the proof-checking techniques.  Cwm's  --why flag
would produce a proof of its current knoweldge base, which a proof validator
could verify, regenerating the knowledge base.  This code has (2004) rotted
in that it wasnot kept up to date with advances in the platform.</p>

<p>Example problem statement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple access control example</li>
</ul>

<p>Ontologies involved (find, or collborate in development of)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital signature generation and verification;
    <p>Proof</p>
  </li>
  <li>Policy in the target ssytem such as access control, transaction
    authorization, etc etc.
    <p>Possibly: RDF ontologies correspnding to existing systems such as
    XKMS, PKI, PGP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proof verification</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Information Management (PIM) Integration</h2>

<p></p>

<p>We have done a lot of this already, but there is a lot mroe to do.</p>

<p>Ontologies involved (find, or collborate in development of)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calendar events (iCalendar)</li>
  <li>Tax forms</li>
  <li>Bank statements</li>
  <li>GPS tracks
    <p>Maps</p>
  </li>
  <li>Email metadata</li>
  <li>Email lists as group membership</li>
  <li>Photo (EXIF)</li>
  <li>Tasks, Bug tracking
    <p>Workflow</p>
  </li>
</ul>
