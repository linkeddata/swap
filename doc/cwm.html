<p>Cwm (pronounced coom) is a general-purpose data processor for the semantic
web, somewhat like sed, awk, etc. for text files or XSLT for XML. It is a
forward chaining reasoner which can be used for querying, checking,
transforming and filtering information. Its core language is RDF, extended to
include rules, and it uses RDF/XML or RDF/N3 (see <a
href="../Primer">Notation3 Primer</a>) serializations as required.</p>

<p>Cwm is <a href="../#L88">written in python</a>; it is part of <a
href="../">SWAP</a>, a Semantic Web Application Platform. It is open source
under the <a href="/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231">W3C
software license</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Closed">Features and Tutorial</h2>

<p>The <a id="Tutorial" href="./">Semantic Web Tutorial Using N3</a> covers
features such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
    href="../../../../2003/Talks/0520-www-tf1-a4-commandline/slide2-0.html">Loading
    files in RDF/XML and/or N3</a>, generating RDF or N3 files from the
    result.
    <ul>
      <li>(The obscure<a href="../test/triage.n3">boring</a> parts of RDF/XML
        syntax, specifically reification and XML Literal parse type,
        are<strong></strong><strong>not</strong> handled by the
        mai<strong></strong>n parser).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pretty printing data so that anonymous nodes are used creatively to
    minimize the number of explicit existentials (generated Ids).</li>
  <li><a
    href="../../../../2003/Talks/0520-www-tf1-b3-rules/slide1-0.html">Applying
    rules written in N3 to the data</a></li>
  <li><a
    href="../../../../2003/Talks/0520-www-tf1-b3-rules/slide19-0.html">Filtering
    the data to the result of a particular query</a></li>
  <li>Generating arbitrary formats (<a
    href="../../../../2003/Talks/0520-www-tf1-b3-rules/slide26-0.html">using
    --strings</a>)</li>
  <li>Using an <a href="Built-in">internal knowledge of functions</a> to
    resolve them within a query, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Simple math and string operations</li>
      <li>Getting and parsing documents from the web</li>
      <li>Accessing command line arguments and environment variables</li>
      <li><a href="Trust">Cryptography</a>: hashing, generating keys, signing
        things and checking signatures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p id="Command">See also: <a href="CwmHelp">Cwm command line arguments
reference</a>.</p>

<p>Other features are in development, and haven't been documented as
thoroughly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accessing the web to directly or indirectly resolve a query, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Getting schemas for terms in the query</li>
      <li>Using metadata to point to definitive documents</li>
      <li>Looking up data in local or remote SQL servers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Environmen" id="Environmen">Environment Variables</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt>CWM_RDF_PARSER</dt>
    <dd>rdflib2rdf or sax2rdf (default). Affects the choice of RDF parser
      module used by cwm.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="Security" id="Security">Security Issues</a></h3>

<p>Be careful when using rules from an untrusted source.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rules can read data from the web, indirectly letting data out by the
    URIs they use.</li>
  <li>Rules can take up your resources such as processor time and memory.</li>
  <li>Rules can pick data up from within the web you have access to,
    including confidential files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be carfeul even when using cryptography. I am not an expert but a few
things to watch are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allways think where the weakest link is. It is not always on the
  net.</li>
  <li>Where do you keep the private key, anyway?</li>
  <li>Beware of all forms of attack, including replay and man in the
  middle.</li>
  <li>Always sign some random junk as well as the critical data to prevent
    the reverse engineering of the key.</li>
  <li>Ask a crypto specialist to look over your stuff</li>
  <li>Make the techniques, rules, code. public. Public debugging is valuable.
    Trying to hide it from attackers by keeping it secret doesn't pay.</li>
  <li>This code is not guaranteed anyway, or made for production use. It is
    designed for prototyping new semantic web applications. Use at your own
    risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="name">About the name <em>cwm</em></h3>

<p>Originally, the name is from from "Closed World Machine" because it
processed information in a limited space, cwm does <em>not</em> make any
assumptions about a closed world. Think of it as defined area but with
openings - like a valley.</p>

      is the main application file. You can browse the source files on the
      web, but this is <strong>not</strong> a practical way to install the
      system.
      <p>In the following, we assume $SWAP expands to the place where you
      have code checked out.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Test Driven Development (Don't trust the docs ;-)</h3>

<p>The best test of works is what has been tested. So the list of files in
the <a href="../test/regression.n3">regression test</a> defines the set of
features which are generally checked on each checkin. Cwm developers agree
that all the tests have to pass before code is checked in. To run the tests,
do <tt>make</tt> in the <tt>swap/test</tt> directory. We reckon to add a test
for a new bug, so that bugs don't recur in future versions.</p>

<p>Each subdirectory of test has its own detailed.tests file. In that you can
put tests for new features. Note that the test commands are all writted to be
run in $SWAP/test.</p>

<h3>How to make a release</h3>
<ol>
  <li>A quick test that your code still works is cd $SWAP/test; make fast</li>
  <li>The test a release must pass before you make it is cd $SWAP/test; make
    pre-release</li>
  <li>Edit $SWAP/Makefile 
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the HTML files generated from any new .py files are added
        to the list HTMLS</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Code Overview</h3>

<p>Cwm developers agree to keep line lengths below 80 characters, though we
have some code that predates that agreement.</p>

<h4>llyn.py - The Store</h4>

<p>An in-memory store which does the inference. See the <a href="">Formula
class methods</a> for a more or less conventional RDF API. A Forumula is a
set of statements.</p>

<h4 id="L133">notation3.py - Serializing/deserializaing RDF/N3</h4>

<p>Originally written by Dan Connolly, uses a basic RDF stream parser
interface, migrating to API</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parses N3</li>
  <li>Generates N3</li>
</ul>

<p>The command line form (alias n3 python notation3.py; n3 -help) allows RDF
to be parsed and re-output.</p>

<p>The module will also run as a CGI script to convert N3 to RDF M&amp;S 1.0
- by DanC magic.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="notation3.py">Source</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="L311">xml2rdf.py Parsing RDF/XML</h4>

<p>Based on Python's xmllib, this parser is compatible with the RDF stream
interface of, notation3.py. It completes the square of parsers and
generators. <strong>Defunct. Now use sax parser and sax2rdf.py.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Parses RDF</li>
</ul>

<p>It has a command line mode for self-test purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="xml2rdf.py">Source</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>cwm_xxx.py - builtin modules</h4>

<p>These are quite easy to add to. Look at a few and clone a similar one to
the one you have made.</p>

<h3><a id="Design" name="Design">Design issues</a></h3>

<p>The code above investigated and raised issues discussed in the following
documents.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/DesignIssues/Notation3.html">Notation 3 - an alternative RDF
    syntax</a></li>
  <li><a href="/DesignIssues/Anonymous.html">Quantification implicit in
    anonymous nodes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>not to mention</p>
<ul>
  <li>RDFM&amp;S and schema issues</li>
  <li>The question of quoting and BagIDs etc</li>
</ul>
