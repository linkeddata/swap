<h1>Cwm TO DO</h1>

<p></p>

<p>Here are things we know need doing. Help is always appreciated. Maybe we
should put this in bugzilla sometime, and certainly in RDF.</p>

<p>Cwm hackers with access (Tim Berners-Lee, Dan Connolly, Sandro Hawke, Eric
Prud'hommeaux...) please feel free to edit this page. (There is a system team
work item to allow more flexible acecss to pages like this by collborators
using CVS.)</p>
