Vocabulary Documentation</p>

<h1>Vocabulary Documentation</h1>

<p>As we read and write N3, communicating in RDF, we need to share an
understanding of what each URI means.  We often pick URIs which offer
clues about meaning, such as
<code>http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/demo1/biology#Dog</code>,
but the text of the URI still gives only a clue.  Would a wolf qualify
as a one of these?  How about a Dingo?  We can't tell just by looking
at the name.  It's even possible the URI text is misleading, and the
intended meaning has nothing to do with dogs.</p>

<p>A good technique for addressing these issues is to <a
href="../Primer#publish">publish</a> a document which 
carefully describes the intended meaning
of each term.  If this description is done carefully enough, following
a precise structure, software can help us understand what the terms
mean, check for some kinds of errors, and sometimes even dynamically
update itself to use and recognize new URIs.</p>

<p>There is a vocabulary of about fifty terms (URIs) being developed by
W3C Working Groups to support this kind of precise documentation.
About a dozen of the terms are part of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDF Vocabulary
Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema</a>, for which we use the
"rdfs:" namespace abbreviation.   The others are part of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL Web Ontology
Language</a>.  
All fifty are listed and
cross referenced in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#TermIndex">OWL Guide Appendix</a>
.</p>

<h2>Plain Documentation</h2>

<p>Rdfs:comment is for providing unstructured documentation, while
rdfs:label can give an easier-to-read name and rdfs:seeAlso gives
untyped links.   This is a good start for unstructured
documentation.</p>

<pre>:CanisFamiliaris 
  rdfs:comment """The class of animals designated 
               Canis familiaris (domestic dog).  This
	       includes all the dog breeds, but
	       not wolves.""";
  rdfs:label "Canis familiaris";
  rdfs:seeAlso &lt;http://www.agrobiologicals.com/glossary/G3089.htm>.</pre>

<h2>Equivalence</h2>

<p>Our simplest machine-readable declaration is that two URIs mean the
same thing:</p>

<pre>:Pat owl:sameAs :Patrick.</pre>

<p>Given this statement, a system which understands
<code>owl:sameAs</code> would know that everything true of
:Pat was also true of :Patrick and everything true of :Patrick was
true of :Pat.  They are just synonyms: two names for the same thing.
This is what N3 means with "=".   (Note that cwm does not
understand any of these terms natively, but can be instructed
to use them, via rules.)</p>

<p>We could also say:</p>

<pre>:Dog owl:equivalentClass :CanisFamiliaris.
  # or 
:Dog owl:sameAs :CanisFamiliaris.</pre>

<p>These two are slightly different: equivalent classes have exactly
the members, but may have a different intended meaning.  If we use
owl:sameAs, then our label "Canis familiaris" would also
apply to :Dog.</p>

<h2>Cardinality</h2>

<p>In some cases equivalence and sameness can be inferred.  OWL has a
vocabulary for talking about "cardinality" of properties, saying
whether they map one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.  If we
have a :mother property, we declare that it is many-to-one
("functional"), indicating that people have at most one biological
mother:</p>

<pre>:mother a owl:FunctionalProperty</pre>

<p>This can be used to infer sameness, because if we say</p>

<pre>:sam :mother :jackie.
:sam :mother :jacqueline.</pre>

<p>a human or machine reader can figure out that ":jackie" and
":jacqueline" must be names for the same individual.</p>

<h2>Different and Disjoint</h2>

<p>Of course it's possible that :jackie and :jacqueline are not the
same person, and that one of the lines about :sam was a mistake!  OWL
has several ways to say that things are not the same; the simplest
would be:</p>

<pre>:jackie owl:differentFrom :jacqueline.</pre>

<p>Taken together, the three statements describe an impossible
situation, and OWL software should be able to recognize and warn about
this situation.</p>

<h2>Class Hierarchies</h2>

<pre>:Man s:subclassOf :Human .
:YoungMan s:subclassOf :Man .</pre>

<pre>:CanisFamiliarisDingo 
  owl:subClassOf :CanisFamiliaris;   # Dingos are Dogs!
  rdfs:seeAlso &lt;http://www.naturalworlds.org/
          wolf/canis/Canis_familiaris_dingo.htm>.

:CanisRufus a owl:Class;
  owl:subClassOf :Canis;
  owl:disjointFrom :CanisFamiliaris;     # Wolves are not Dogs!
  rdfs:label "Red Wolf";
  rdfs:comment """As of 1999 there were about 300 individuals 
               of this endangered species""";
  rdfs:seeAlso &lt;http://druidry.org/obod/endangered/redwolf.html>.
