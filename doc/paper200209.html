<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>To be part of the Semantic Web, a document must convey its content
as machine-readable statements of relationships which exist between
things.  This is an abstract view of knowledge, rooted in formal
logic, which is flexible, well-understood by experts, and suitable for
processing by computers.  Documents like this have an underlying
similarity, despite possible differences in surface syntax, which
allows software to reason about collections of the documents and their
contents.
</p>

<p>The basic techniques of processing documents in formal languages
have been understood since at least 1970, but they have perhaps not
yet really met the Web.  Traditionally, reasoners have operated on a
specific knowledge base, maintained by a centralized authority.  The
web has no central authority, and documents are always appearing and
disappearing.  Reasoning with such a knowledge base presents new
challenges. </p>

<p>In our work, we have considered two areas which seem crucial to the
function of the Semantic Web: shared naming and reasoning about
documents.  Shared naming addresses the problem of using logic
formulas as messages, considering the degree to which sender and
receiver share an interpretation of various vocabulary terms.
Reasoning about documents involves putting documents into the domain
of discourse (reifying them), so that we can ...  ugh.

<p>To date, most Semantic Work seems to use RDF/XML.  While we
understand the need for a common language, it was never designed to be
manipulated by hand.  For reading and writing, we need languages that
are easier for people to read and write; we've experimented with some
of these (primarily an evolving language called N3).   In some cases
these language appear to have a greater expressive power than RDF, but
we'll show how that's a false comparison since RDF itself has a
variable expressive power depending on the which vocabulary terms are
considered to be part of the language.

<p>older stuff</p>


<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
We suggest that RDF's limited expressive power can be extended safely
to the level of classical first-order logic by using a combination of
reification and a <em>stratified</em> truth predicate.  First we
formalize RDF in terms of classical logic.  Then, we survey
prior work on reification vocabularies and suggest a new candidate
(called LX), and define it and the truth predicate with axioms.  We
show how to use a resolution theorem prover (Otter) and a tabled
prolog compiler (XSB) to work with reified-and-asserted knowledge on
sample problems.  Finally, we suggest that adoption of LX reasoners
could allow other logics (such as RDFS and OWL) to be trivially
deployed for applications needing only moderate performance.
</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
As a knowledge representation language, RDF has very little expressive
power.  Without an extension to its vocabulary, an RDF document can do
no more than state the values of properties of things.  RDF critics
have argued that more expressivity is needed [@]. RDF advocates have
replied that this is enough because (1) it is all we need for most
important applications [@], and (2) more expressive power can be added
at a "higher layer" [@].
</p>

<p>
The mechanism and even the feasibility of adding expressive power
has been debated.  While the RDFS vocabulary appears to succesfully
extend RDF from being a minimalist frame system to being a weak
description logic [@], attempts to define a vocabulary for a
stronger description logic, DAML+OIL, have run into controversy [@].
In general, the prospect of adding expressive power at higher layers
has been brought into question [Patel-Shneider02].
</p>

<p>
People have already defined RDF vocabularies for logical systems close
to classical first-order logic [Berners-Lee00, McDermott01, Hawke01,
McDermott02], but they have failed to address precisely how such
systems might productively interact with the underlying RDF.  It has
been suggested that doing so would lead to catastrophic failures due
to paradoxes of self-reference, but we believe these problems can be
avoided.
</p>

<p>@@ talk about classical logic</p>

<h2>2. RDF as a Predicate Logic</h2>

<p>RDF follows the traditions of semantic networks [@], which 
are well known to be equalivalent to classical logic or some subset of
classical logic [@].</p>

<p>At its simplest, and RDF graph is equivalent to a conjunction of
ground binary atomic sentences, but there are few twists:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Some node and arc labels are document scope; these are equivalent
to using existentially quantified variables as labels, so we must
allow this quantification over entire RDF sentences.
</li>
<li>Common inferences, such as used in RDFS, quantify over predicates,
which is not a first-order operation, so we'll use a super-predicate
to wrap the binary atomic sentences, like <em>rdf(subject, predicate,
object)</em>.
</li>
<li>RDF has several kinds of strings (called "literals" in the RDF
literature, but not to be confused with "literals" in automated theorem proving
literature, which are possibly-negated atomic formulas), which are
immediately known to be pairwise equal or distinct.   This is
addressed below in section 2.1.
</li>
<li>The text of universal-scope labels on RDF nodes and arcs may be
available to processing software and should not, in our opinion,
simply be discarded or held to be entirely opaque.  We suggest that if
true opacity were desired, UUIDs would server as far better labels
than URIRefs.  We make this "microstructure" information available by
using a "webDenotation" function, which maps many-to-one from
character strings (which are URIRefs according to RDF) to objects in
the domain of discourse.
</li>

</ol>

<p>By viewing RDF as a sublanguage of first-order logic, our mechanism
for reifying first-order logic (section 3) can be used for reifying
RDF graphs.</p>

<h3>2.1 RDF Strings</h3>

<p>We consider basic strings to be sequences of unicode characters.
These can be assembled using four primitive terms: first, rest, nil,
and unicode.   "unicode" is itself a list of the unicode characters,
in code sequence order.       @@more details   @@unicode versioning
</p>

<p>@@@ RDF String also have the is-XML bit, and the language
attribute.
</p>

<h2>3. Vocabularies for Reification</h2>

<p>Berners-Lee suggested that first-order formula could be
conveyed in RDF with a quoting operator, but did not precisely define
a mapping to triples.</p>

<p>McDermott showed that one could describe first-order formulas using
RDF triples, and with only a number of triples proportional to the
complexity of the formula.</p>

<p>We find one flaw in McDermott's vocabulary design, which prompts us 
to consider some design decisions.
</p>

<p>@@ handling of RDF inferences (spontaneous delabeling, relabing,
and merging); distinguishing constants from variables at what
level?   Flaw in McDermott's.</p>

<p>@@ community of users, "and" vs "conjunction"</p>

<p>@@ binary vs n-ary</p>

<p>@@ in-line (log:implies, or  "a and b") </p>

<p>@@ LX binary, Drews, Kif, Tim's ...? </p>


<h2>4. Truth Predicates</h2>

<p>A truth predicate lets us get from "There is a sentence which
says there is a fire in this building" to "There is a fire in this
building!".   We do it by saying "There is a <em>true</em> sentence
which says there is a fire in this building."</p>

<p>But we have to be careful: that same <em>true</em> might be used to
say things like: "There is a sentence which says that it, the sentence
itself, is not <em>true</em>."  This is the classic liar paradox
("This is a lie!").   Is that sentence true?   It's a touchy subject.
</p>

<p>This is but the simplest paradox of self-reference; there are
trickier ones, like Curry's, and many of them have been studied at
great length</p>

<p>@@@@ Solutions:
kif3, 
kif98 (truth predicate only at top level), 
stratification, 
stratification of negation

<h2>5. Application Experience</h2>

<pre>
otter
xsb
translators
axioms
[cwm???]

what apps?

web-lookup of axioms

performance
</pre>

<h2>6. Issues</h2>

<pre>
why not just use java?     composibility, I think.

performance - open-ended badness!

too confusing

not rdf style

web-loop self reference; open world
</pre>

<h2>7. Conclusions</h2>

this stuff is great, but can get slow, and is not likely to replace
conventional programming any time soon.
