This module makes it easy to have hot-swappable software components.

This may be useful if your code needs the services of something
implementing some interface, and you want to be able to change
implementation while running.  If you only wanted to change at the
start of a run, you could just set up your PYTHONPATH (sys.path) to
put the preferred implementations first.  But if you want the user to
have drop-down menu for which algorithm to use, this may simplify your
program.

As an example, consider a long-running program (some kind of agent,
perhaps an IRC bot) which needs a variety of protocol drivers for
speaking to various other agents.  With this hotswap, each time the
program needs to use such a driver after a possible configuration
change, it says something like:

    my_irc_client = hotswap.get(irc.Client)

and it gets an instance of the irc.Client class.  By default,
each time you call "plugins.get(irc.Client)" you will get
the same client instance.

However, you can modify hotswap's list of places to look for drivers.
If you add another place to the front of the list, ...

   hotswap.prepend("/usr/local/irc7/python/irc")

hotswap may return a different instance at the next get() call.  By
default, the constructor for the new instance will be passed a
"copyFrom" parameter so it can extract any useful state from the old
instance.  (This behavior can be controlled with the transferMode
parameter on get()).

A more sophisticated use is to separate the identity of the service
provider from the its features.  Perhaps you need three simultaneous
irc.Client implementations, and one of them has to also be an
irc.DCC_Client.

   client1 = hotswap.get("cl1", interfaces=[irc.Client])
   client2 = hotswap.get("cl2", interfaces=[irc.Client])
   client3 = hotswap.get("cl3", interfaces=[irc.Client, irc.DCC_Client])

Here the service names are arbitrary immutable objects, and interfaces
parameter provides a list of classes which the chosen resulting class
must inherit from.  See get() for all the details on filter featuring,
transferMode control, and passing initialization arguments to new
service providers.

This module offers both a shared interface (as shown above) and also a
HotSwapManager class, which you can use in the unlikely event you want
multiple simultaneous hotswap configurations.
