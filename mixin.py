$ID:    $

We want to be able to mixin query functions
These include:

substitution(self, bindings, why=None):
substituteEquals(self, bindings, newRedirections):
occurringIn(self, vars):
unify(self, other, vars, existentials,  bindings):

we want the interface to be convenient.

Here is how to use it:

Let us say, in one file, you have a class foo

class foo(object):
    def something(self):
        ...

and you want to add a other() method to it. Create another file,
and do as follows

------
from mixin import Mixin

class betterFoo(Mixin, foo):
    def other(self):
        ....

----
and import that file where you need to use betterFoo, even AFTER the
objects are created!
