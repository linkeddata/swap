dc:description """
 To illustrate with examples the creation of a schema of RDF properties
 and classes, but using abstract things for people, rather than strings, etc.
 If you have an "Assistant's phone number", then really you have an assitant who has
 a phone number - and that is much more useful in general.
 For example, when data about you and your assietnt in merged,
 you will end up with an "assistant's email" and the like.
""",
"$Id$". # see changelog at the bottom.
