#    Utility concepts for everyday Personal Information Mangement  - CALENDARING
#    ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# To illustrate with examples the creation of a schema of RDF properties
# and classes, but using abstract things for people, rather than strings, etc.
# If you have an "Assistant's phone number", thenreally you have an assitant who has
# a phone number - and that is much more useful in general.
# For example, when data about you and your assietnt in merged,
# you will end up with an "assistant's email" and the like.
