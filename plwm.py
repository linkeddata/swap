     plwm (pronounced plume) is a plugable rewrite of cwm.  it should
     be a drop-in replacement, eventually renamed cwm.py.  Or maybe
     staying plwm, as "plugable web machine".

     does --n3  mean the new default language is n3, or the new
     default parser is Notation3 ?   I think it's the language,
     which means (1) you need a parser which can handle it, and
     (2) you need to tell the parser that's the language.

    The host passes itself (or a different host) to the components it
    calls to allow for a flexible callback/dialog mechanism.  This
    allows the components access to virtual system state: they can
    look at option flags, produce debugging output, read and write
    files, etc, ... all managed through one interface.   In fact, they
    are expected to run in a restricted execution environment where
    they can ONLY do these things through this interface.

    If you don't want to some component to be able to do something,
    pass it a different host which disallows those things.

    We do all the handling of hotswap here.  Components (eg parsers)
    should not need to know about that.  If they need a Store to pass
    to, we'll hand them one.  If they need a particular KIND of store,
    .... um ... um ....     Maybe they should use hotswap.
