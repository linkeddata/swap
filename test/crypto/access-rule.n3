# Rules for access in imaginary access control situations
#
#  This is an example of all the processing done by a
#  digital-signatue-aware inference engine in validating a
#  request for access to a member access page.
# 
#  This is simplified, of course, but the whole thing is very straightforward.
#  Enhancements would be to:
#   - put expiry dates in certificates
#   - do a revokation check back to a signed revokation list
#   -

# Notes.  This uses two levels, request and credentials (certificate)
#        It would have been even simpler in fact to declare recursively but
#        would have been open to denial of service by very long chains
