# Experiments with Cwm rules.
#
# After my first attempt at home network configuration with RDF [1], I thought
# some more about Cwm rules for manipulating access permissions.  To get
# some purchase on the problem, I start by tackling some very much simpler
# rules based on the following properties:
#
#   ?A rule:append ( ?L ?T1 )
# is true when ?A is the same as the result of appending ?T1 to the list ?L.
#
#   ?A rule:reverse ?B
# is true when ?A is the same as the list obtained by reversing the members 
# of list ?B
#
# These goals are stated in structural terms, but I they can be motivated by
# semantic conditions about an ascending or descending list of numbers.
#
# Results:
#
# Not quite what I expected.  Using the Cwm --think option, the recursive 
# definition for rule:append gets applied just once.  Interestingly, though,
# if I apply Cwm to its own output, specifying the --think option again,
# I get an error:
#
#  File "F:\W3C\swap1111\llyn.py", line 482, in the
#    assert len(hits) == 1, "There should only be one match for %s %s %s." %(subj , pred, obj)
#  AssertionError: There should only be one match for _g1 first None.

# rule:append
# -----------
#
#   ?A rule:append ( ?L ?T1 )
#
# is true when ?A is the same as the result of appending ?T1 to the list ?L.
#
#   ?A rule:append ( [ ?H :: ?T ]  ?T1 )
# =>
#   ?A daml:first ?H ;
#      daml:rest  [ rule:append ( ?T ?T1 ) ] .
#
#   ?A rule:append ( daml:nil ?T1 )
# =>
#   ?A daml:first ?T1 ;
#      daml:rest  daml:nil .
#

{ 
  ?A rule:append ( [ daml:first ?H ; daml:rest ?T ] ?T1 ) .
}
log:implies
{ 
  ?A daml:first ?H ;
     daml:rest  [ rule:append ( ?T ?T1 ) ] .
} .

# The following rule, when enabled, causes a different error:
#
#  File "F:\W3C\swap1111\llyn.py", line 2402, in query2
#    existentials.remove(pair[0]) # Can't match anything anymore, need exact match
#  ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list
#

#{ 
#  ?A rule:append ( daml:nil ?T1 ) .
#}
#log:implies
#{ 
#  ?A daml:first ?T1 ;
#     daml:rest  daml:nil .
#} .

# Test cases

:A1 rule:append ( ( "L11" "L12" "L13" ) "L14" ) .

#:A2 rule:append (  :A1 "L2" ) .

#:A3 rule:append (  :A1 "L3" ) .

#
# I note that the notation
#   [ ?H :: ?T ]
# as a shorthand for:
#   [ daml:first ?H ; daml:rest ?T ]
# or
#   [ rdf:first ?H ; rdf:rest ?T ]
# might be convenient.
