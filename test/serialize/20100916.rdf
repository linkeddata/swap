  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The GoodRelations ontology provides the vocabulary for annotating e-commerce offerings (1) to sell, lease, repair, dispose, or maintain commodity products and (2) to provide commodity services.

GoodRelations allows describing the relationship between (1) Web resources, (2) offerings made by those Web resources, (3) legal entities, (4) prices, (5) terms and conditions, and the aforementioned ontologies for products and services (6).

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An Actual Product or Service Instance is a single identifiable object or action that creates some increase in utility (in the economic sense) for the individual possessing or using this very object (Product) or for the individual in whose favor this very action is being taken (Service). Products or Services are types of goods in the economic sense. For an overview of goods and commodities in economics, see Milgate (1987).

Examples: MyThinkpad T60, the pint of beer standing in front of me, my Volkswagen Golf, the haircut that I received or will be receiving at a given date and time.

Note: In many cases, product or service instances are not explicitly exposed on the Web but only claimed to exist (i.e. existentially quantified). For a detailed discussion and practical solutions, see section 3.3.3 of the GoodRelations Technical Report.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The minimal and maximal amount of time that is required between accepting the Offering and the actual usage of the resource or service. This is mostly relevant for offers regarding hotel rooms, the rental of objects, or the provisioning of services. The duration is specified relatively to the beginning of the usage of the contracted object. It is represented by attaching an instance of the class QuantitativeValueInteger. The lower and upper boundaries are specified using the datatype properties hasMinValueInteger and hasMaxValueInteger to that instance. The unit of measurement is specified using the datatype property hasUnitOfMeasurement with a string holding a UN/CEFACT code suitable for durations, e.g. MON (months), DAY (days), HUR (hours), or MIN (minutes).

The difference to the validFrom and validThrough properties is that those specify the interval during which the Offering is valid, while advanceBookingRequirement specifies the acceptable relative amount of time between accepting the offer and the fulfilment or usage.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An instance of this class represents the legal agent making (or seeking) a particular offering. This can be a legal body or a person. A Business Entity has at least a primary mailing address and contact details. For this, typical address standards (vCard) and location data can be attached. Note that the location of the Business Entity is not necessarily the location from which the product or service is being available (e.g. the branch or store). Use gr:LocationOfSalesOrServiceProvisioning for stores and branches.

Example: Siemens Austria AG, Volkswagen Ltd., Peter Miller&apos;s Cell phone Shop LLC

Note:  Typical address standards (vcard) and location data should be attached to a business entity. Since there already exist established vocabularies for this, the GoodRelations ontology does not provide respective attributes. Instead, the use of respective vocabularies is recommended. However, the hasGlobalLocationNumber and hasDUNS properties are provided for linking to respective identifiers for business locations.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A Business Entity Type is a conceptual entity representing the legal form, the size, the main line of business, the position in the value chain, or any combination thereof, of a Business Entity. From the ontological point of view, Business Entity Types are mostly roles that a Business Entity has in the market. Business Entity Types are important for specifying eligible customers, since Offerings are often meant only for Business Entities of a certain size, legal structure, or role in the value chain.

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The Business Function specifies the type of activity or access (i.e., the bundle of rights) offered by the Business Entity on the Product or Services though the Offering. The idea of standardizing business functions was first put to practice by the UNSPSC Business Functions Identifiers (UNSPSC BFI). We take their basic types of business functions as a starting point. Typical are sell, rental or lease, maintenance or repair, manufacture / produce, recycle / dispose, engineering / construction, or installation.

Licenses and other proprietary specifications of access rights are also instances of this class.

Examples: A particular offering made by Miller Rentals Ltd. says that they (1) sell Volkswagen Golf convertibles, (2) lease out a particular Ford pick-up truck, and (3) dispose car wrecks of any make and model.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A Delivery Charge Specification is a conceptual entity that specifies the additional costs asked for the delivery of a given Offering using a particular Delivery Method by the respective Business Entity. A Delivery Charge Specification is characterized by (1) a monetary amount per order specified as a literal value of type float in combination with a Currency, (2) the Delivery Method, (3) the target Country or Region, and (4)  whether this charge includes local sales taxes, namely VAT.
An Offering may be linked to multiple Delivery Charge Specifications that specify alternative charges for disjoint combinations of target Countries or Regions, and Delivery Methods.

Examples: Delivery by direct download is free of charge worldwide, delivery by UPS to Germany is 10 Euros per order, delivery by Mail within the US is 5 Euros per order.

The total amount of this charge is specified as a float value of the hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the hasCurrency datatype property. Whether the price includes VAT or not is indicated by the valueAddedTaxIncluded datatype property.

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A Delivery Method is a standardized procedure for transferring the Product or Service Instance to the destination of fulfilment chosen by the customer. Delivery Methods are characterized by the means of transportation used, and by the organization or group that is the contracting party for the sending Business Entity (this is important, since the contracted party may subcontract the fulfilment to smaller, regional businesses).

MPNs can be assigned to products or product datasheets, or bundles. Accordingly, the domain of this property is the union of gr:ProductOrService (the common superclass of goods and datasheets), and gr:Offering.

Important: Be careful when assuming two Products or Services instances or Offering instances to be identical based on the MPN. Since MPNs are unique only for the same Business Entity, this holds only when the two MPN values refer to the same Business Entity. Such can be done by taking into account the provenance of the data. 

Usually, the properties hasEAN_UCC-13 and hasGTIN-14 are much more reliable identifiers, because they are globally unique.

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The Stock Keeping Unit, or SKU is a unique identifier for a product, service, or bundle from the perspective of a particular supplier, i.e. SKUs are mostly assigned and serialized at the merchant level. 
Examples of SKUs are the ordering or parts numbers used by a particular Web shop or catalog.

Consequently, the domain of hasStockKeepingUnit is the union of the classes Offering and Product Or Service. 
If attached to an Offering, the SKU will usually reflect a merchant-specific identifier, i.e. one valid only for that particular retailer or shop. 
If attached to a Product Or Service Model, the SKU can reflect either the identifier used by the merchant or the part number used by the official manufacturer of that part. For the latter, gr:hasMPN is a better choice.

Important: Be careful when assuming two Products or Services instances or Offering instances to be identical based on the SKU. Since SKUs are unique only for the same Business Entity, this can be assumed only when you are sure that the two SKU values refer to the same Business Entity. Such can be done by taking into account the provenance of the data. As long as instances of Offering are concerned, you can also check that the offerings are being offered by the same Business Entity.

Usually, the properties hasEAN_UCC-13 and hasGTIN-14 are much more reliable identifiers, because they are globally unique.

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A Location of Sales or Service Provisioning is a location from which the specified Business Function on the particular Product or Service Instance is being offered by the Business Entity. Large enterprises often maintain multiple branches from which the delivery or fulfilment can be provided. In this case, the location of the main office of the Business Entity does not state from where a customer can actually get the Offering. In the case of a chain store, it may be all of the actual shops. For mail order companies, the location will usually be the headquarter of the Business Entity.

Locations of Sales or Service Provisioning are characterized by an address or geographical position and a set of opening hour specifications for various days of the week.

Example: A rental car company may offer the Business Function Lease Out of cars from two locations, one in Fort Myers, Florida, and one in Boston, Massachussetts. Both stations are open 7:00 - 23:00 Mondays through Saturdays.

Note:  Typical address standards (vcard) and location data should be attached to a Location of Sales or Service Provisioning. Since there already exist established vocabularies for this, the GoodRelations ontology does not provide respective attributes. Instead, the use of respective vocabularies is recommended. However, the hasGlobalLocationNumber property is  provided for linking to respective identifiers for business locations.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An Offering represents the public, not necessarily binding, not necessarily exclusive, announcement by a Business Entity to provide (or seek) a certain Business Function for a certain Product or Service Instance to a specified target audience. An Offering is specified by the type of product or service or bundle it refers to, what Business Function is being offered (sales, rental, ...), and a set of commercial properties. It can either refer to 
(1) a clearly specified instance (Actual Product Or Service Instance),
(2) to a set of anonymous instances of a given type (Product Or Services Some Instances Placeholder,
(3) a product model specification (Product Or Service Model),
see also section 3.3.3 of the GoodRelations Technical Report). An offering may be constrained in terms of the eligible type of business partner, countries, quantities, and other commercial properties. The definition of the commercial properties, the type of product offered, and the business function are explained in other parts of this ontology in more detail.

A Payment Charge Specification is characterized by (1) a monetary amount per order specified as a literal value of type float in combination with a Currency, (2) the Payment Method, and (3) a whether this charge includes local sales taxes, namely VAT.
An Offering may be linked to multiple Payment Charge Specifications that specify alternative charges for various Payment Methods.

Examples: Payment by VISA or Mastercard costs a fee of 3 Euros including VAT, payment by bank transfer in advance is free of charge.

The total amount of this surcharge is specified as a float value of the hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the hasCurrency datatype property. Whether the price includes VAT or not is indicated by the valueAddedTaxIncluded datatype property. The Payment Method to which this charge applies is specified using the appliesToPaymentMethod object property.

If the price can only be given as a range, use hasMaxCurrencyValue and hasMinCurrencyValue for the upper and lower bounds.

Important: When querying for the price, always use hasMaxCurrencyValue and hasMinCurrencyValue.</rdfs:comment>

An instance of this class can be either an actual product or service, a placeholder instance for unknown instances of a mass-produced commodity, or a model / prototype specification
.
Since eClassOWL and other large products and services ontologies are used for both describing product and services instances and product and service makes and models, this top-level concept is the union of (1) Actual Product or Service Instances, (2) Product or Service Models, and (3) Product Or Services Some Instances Placeholders. The latter are &quot;dummy&quot; instances representing anonymous products or services instances (i.e., such that are said to exist but not actually being exposed on the Web).

See the GoodRelations Technical Report for more details on this.

Examples: 
a) MyCellphone123, i.e. my personal, tangible cell phone
b) Siemens1234, i.e. the Siemens cell phone make and model 1234
c) dummyCellPhone123 as a placeholder for actual instances of a certain kind of cell phones.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">From the ontological perspective, a Product or Service Model is an intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced Products. In case of mass-produced Products, there exists a relation hasMakeAndModel between the Products and Services Instance and the Product or Service Model. 

Since eClassOWL and other products and services ontologies don&apos;t support this important disctinction, Product or Service Models are a subclass of Product or Service in GoodRelations. This allows using the same properties for (e.g. &quot;hasWeight&quot;) for product models and actual products.

Examples: Ford T, Volkswagen Golf, Sony Ericsson W123 cell phone

Note: An Actual Product or Service Instance of which is known via a relation hasMakeAndModel that it is of a certain Product Or Service Model should by default share the features of this model (e.g. the weight). However, this requires non-standard reasoning. See the GoodRelations Wiki at http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/wiki/GoodRelations for respective rule sets.</rdfs:comment>

Example: An instance of this class can represent an anonymous set of green Siemens1234 phones. It is different from the Product Or Service Model Siemens1234, since this refers to the make and model, and it is different from a particular instance of this make and model (e.g. my individual phone) since the latter can be sold only once.</rdfs:comment>

The business function Provide Service is to be used with such goods that are Services, while Maintain and Repair can be used with goods for which only the class of product exists in the ontology, but not the respective type of service.

Example: Car maintenance could be expressed both as &quot;Provide Service Car Maintenance&quot; or &quot;Maintain Cars&quot;. Since existing ontologies for goods often tangle products and services, it seems beneficial to include Provide Service as a business function.</rdfs:comment>

It is to be interpreted in combination with the respective Unit Of Measurement. Most quantitative values are intervals even if they are in practice often treated as a single point.

An instance of this class is an actual value for a quantitative property of a product. This instance is usually characterized by a minimal value, a maximal value, and a unit of measurement. This class is a work-around caused by the fact that OWL does only support binary relations, and that datatype ranges cannot be easily handled in OWL.

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This is a conceptual entity that collates the components of the underlying quaternary relation between an Offering and the included objects, namely the Product or Service, the Quantity, the Unit Of Measurement, and the Offering to which this belongs.

Note: The link between an Offering and a Type And Quantity Node is represented by the object property includesObject. The Unit of Measurement is attached using the hasUnitOfMeasurement datatype property. The quantity is specified using the datatype property amountOfThisGood (float). The specification of the item included is represented by the object property typeOfGood. 

Example: An offering may consist of 100g of Butter and 1 kg of potatoes, or 1 cell phone and 2 headsets.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A Unit Price Specification is a conceptual entity that specifies the price asked for a given Offering by the respective Business Entity. An Offering may be linked to multiple Unit Price Specifications that specify alternative prices for non-overlapping sets of conditions (e.g. quantities or sales regions). 

A Unit Price Specification is characterized by (1) the lower and upper limits and the Unit of Measurement of the eligible quantity, (2) by a monetary amount per unit of the Product or Service Instance in the given Unit of Measurement specified as a literal value of type float in combination with a Currency, and (3)  whether this prices includes local sales taxes, namely VAT.

Example: The price, including VAT, for 1 kg of a given material is 5 Euros per kg for 0 - 5 kg and 4 Euros for quantities above 5 kg.

The eligible quantity interval for a given price is specified using the object property hasEligibleQuantity, which points to an instance of Quantitative Value. The currency is specified using the hasCurrency datatype property, which points to an ISO 4217 currency code. The unit of measurement for the eligible quantity is specified using the hasUnitOfMeasurement datatype property, which points to an UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters).

In most cases, the appropriate unit of measurement is the UN/CEFACT Common Code &quot;C62&quot; for &quot;Unit or piece&quot;, since an Offering is defined by the quantity and unit of measurement of all items included (e.g. &quot;1 kg of bananas plus a 2 kg of apples&quot;). As long at the Offering consists of only one item, it is also possible to use an unit of measurement  of choice for specifying the price per unit. For bundles, however, only  &quot;C62&quot; for &quot;Unit or piece&quot; is a valid unit of measurement .

Whether VAT and sales taxes are included in this price is specified using the datatype property valueAddedTaxIncluded (boolean).

The price per unit of measurement is specified as a float value of the hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the hasCurrency datatype property. Whether the price includes VAT or not is indicated by the valueAddedTaxIncluded datatype property.

The property priceType can be used to indicate that the price is a retail price recommendation only (i.e. a list price). 

If the price can only be given as a range, use hasMaxCurrencyValue and hasMinCurrencyValue for the upper and lower bounds.

Important: When querying for the price, always use hasMaxCurrencyValue and hasMinCurrencyValue.

Note: Due to the complexity of pricing scenarios in various industries, it may be necessary to create extensions of this fundamental model of Price Specifications. Such can be done easily by importing and refining the GoodRelations ontology.</rdfs:comment>

A Warranty Promise is an entity representing the duration and scope of services that will be provided to a customer free of charge in case of a defect or malfunction of the Product or Service Instance. A Warranty Promise is characterized by its temporal duration (usually starting with the date of purchase) and its Warranty Scope. The Warranty Scope represents the types of services provided (e.g. labor and parts, just parts) of the warranty included in an Offering. The actual services may be provided by the Business Entity making the Offering, by the manufacturer of the Product, or by a third party. There may be multiple Warranty Promises associated with a particular Offering, which differ in duration and scope (e.g. pick-up service during the first 12 months, just parts and labor for 36 months).
